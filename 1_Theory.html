<h2>Text/Content Analysis in Social Science</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Researchers have long recognised that much of what is social interaction is expressed through words.</li>
<li class="fragment">Traditionally these texts are analysed using content analysis in one of several forms (e.g., Quantitative Content Analysis, Discourse Analysis or Hermeneutic Content Analysis).</li>
<li class="fragment">The goal was to understand what actors are saying and writing and sometimes why they might say or write something.</li>
<li class="fragment">The steps could involve theory/category building, classification of text and finding relations between texts/actors</li>
<li class="fragment">But scholars struggle with volume: <strong><em>there are often simply too many relevant texts</em></strong>.</li>
<li class="fragment">At least linear increase of costs with larger text corpora (structured collections of text).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="promises-of-automatic-content-analysis" class="slide level2">
<h2>Promises of Automatic Content Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><em>Systematic analysis</em> of large-scale text collections without massive funding support.</li>
<li class="fragment">Depending on the method, results are available almost immediately</li>
<li class="fragment">Perfect reliability in the sense that presented the same data and method, the computer will generate same results.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="pitfalls-of-automatic-content-analysis-four-principles" class="slide level2">
<h2>Pitfalls of Automatic Content Analysis: Four Principles</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li class="fragment">All quantitative models of language are wrong—but some are useful</li>
<li class="fragment">Quantitative methods augment humans, not replace them</li>
<li class="fragment">There is no globally best method for automated text analysis</li>
<li class="fragment">Validate, Validate, Validate!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Problem with 4: The discipline is still young and validation methods are often not canonical or do not exist yet.</li>

<h2>Reducing Complexity: From Words to Numbers | The single most important concept in ACA</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Principle: bag-of-words: ignoring word order &amp; grammar (surprisingly good results)</li>
<li class="fragment">Different names, the same concept: dfm (document-feature-matrix), dtm (document-term-matrix); tdm</li>
<li class="fragment">Potential problem: homographs (although rarely important)</li>
<li class="fragment">An example:
<ul>
<li class="fragment">The bandage was wound around the wound.</li>
<li class="fragment">The farm was cultivated to produce produce.</li>
<li class="fragment">The dump was so full that the workers had to refuse more refuse.</li>

<ul>
<li class="fragment"><em>“Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data via data mining techniques. These features can be used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.”</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">Wikipedia: Feature engineering</a></li>
<li class="fragment">The process of standardizing, removing or merging features can have substantial important implications for the results:
<ul>
<li class="fragment">positive: can improve performance by selecting only what is important.</li>
<li class="fragment">negative: can lead to over-fitting or important features being removed by accident.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Feature engineering | (AKA Preprocessing)</h2>
<p>Most common steps:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Removing <em>Punctuation, Numbers and other symbols</em> (e.g., @ or #).</li>
<li class="fragment">Grouping word forms via <em>Stemming/Lemmatisation</em> (am, are, is <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> be; car, cars, car’s, cars’ <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> car).</li>
<li class="fragment">Removing <em>Stopword</em> which are unlikely to convey much information (e.g., the, was, to).</li>
<li class="fragment">Removing <em>Infrequent Terms</em> to reduce size of vocabulary and/or remove terms that do not contribute to analysis.</li>
<li class="fragment">Including <em>n-grams</em> to capture important/otherwise ambiguous multiword expressions (e.g., “national security” vs.&nbsp;“national debt”).</li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Compounding</em> is similar to <em>n-grams</em> but only a specific list of multiword expressions is used (e.g., “New York” <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> “New_York”)</li>
